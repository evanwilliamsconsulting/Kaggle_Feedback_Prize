They are always on their phone more than 5 hours a day no stop .All they do is text back and forward and just have group Chats on social media. They even do it while driving. They are some really bad consequences when stuff happens when it comes to a phone. Some certain areas in the United States ban phones from class rooms just because of it.When people have phones, they know about certain apps that they have .Apps like Facebook Twitter Instagram and Snapchat. So like if a friend moves away and you want to be in contact you can still be in contact by posting videos or text messages. People always have different ways how to communicate with a phone. Phones have changed due to our generation.Driving is one of the way how to get around. People always be on their phones while doing it. Which can cause serious Problems. That's why there's a thing that's called no texting while driving. That's a really important thing to remember. Some people still do it because they think It's stupid. No matter what they do they still have to obey it because that's the only way how did he save.Sometimes on the news there is either an accident or a suicide. It might involve someone not looking where they're going or tweet that someone sent. It either injury or death. If a mysterious number says I'm going to kill you and they know where you live but you don't know the person's contact,It makes you puzzled and make you start to freak out. Which can end up really badly.\n"

of itwhen people have phones they know about certain apps that they have apps like facebook twitter instagram and snapchat so like if a friend moves away and you want to be in contact you can still be in contact by posting videos or text messages people always have different ways how to communicate with a phone phones have changed due to our generationdriving is one of the way how to get around people always be on their phones while doing it which can cause serious problems thats why theres a thing thats called no texting while driving thats a really important thing to remember some people still do it because they think its stupid no matter what they do they still have to obey it because thats the only way how did he savesometimes on the news there is either an accident or a suicide it might involve someone not looking where theyre going or tweet that someone sent it either injury or death if a mysterious number says im going to kill you and they know where you live but you dont

fruition by the use of letters this system was found to be rather slow and new pathways were searched for until the invention of the telegram the people thought it was an invention of the millennia but after time it too was thought of as slow until the invention of the telephone today a telephone is in the hand or pocket of a majority of the seven billion people on planet earth however this device is taken to areas that it is irresponsible and dangerouswithin a vehicle capable of traveling upwards of one hundred miles per hour any possible distraction can become fatal spontaneously the most common of these distractions is a cell phone with its capabilities to connect us to anyone also in ownership of one it is easy to pick it up whenever it sounds in that split second of reaching over for a phone eyes no longer on the road it is impossible to no an exact location of anything making an extremely dangerous action for the myriad of possibilities that lead to serious injury cell phones should stay in the current state they are in regards of the law but taken as a more serious offenseconversely people may believe that laws in present need to change becoming less restrictive people have the right to communicate with whom they wish when or wherever they may choose to do so the problem becomes apparent that this is a selfish process of thought people arent thinking of those they share the road with laws currently in place are not to punish people making poor choices they are an attempt to keep people safe', 'the first reason why the use of cell phones shouldnt be allowed while operating a vehicle because there are high chances of vehicle collisions happening most vehicle collisions happen when the driver is texting or under the influence of alcohol when people who drives while texting spend more time looking at their phone than the road causing poor carfollowing ability and lateral lane control while under the influence of alcohol it can cause you to lose concentration and it can also hinder your ability to make rational decisionsas stated before these are some examples of what can cause vehicle collisionsthe second reason why you shouldnt operate a cell phone while driving because of slow reaction timereaction time is the measure of how quickly an organism can respond to a particular stimulus when your spending time at your phone and finally look up to see youre about to get into an accident it would already be too late reaction times with no activity were between one and two seconds reaction times while using a cellphone were at least three to four seconds on top of that drivers were more likely to miss the flashing light altogether when using a cellphone cellphones effects the nervous system when a person is drivingthe last reason you shouldnt drive while using a cellphone because it can cause fatal injuries that might have longterm or shortterm affects the affects can be physical emotional or psychological one of the most common physical effect is whiplash whiplash is caused by a sudden movement of the neck whiplash is usually caused by rear end automobile collisions one emotional effect can be anxiety which can cause difficulties in certain situations involving driving the last effect is psychological which can cause ptsd most car accidents are the results of ptsd but can also be caused by any traumatic experience

guilt', 'over half of drivers in todays society have this horrible habit of texting and driving this has to stop immediately texting and driving puts peoples lives at risk this simple act has caused

in their hand or touching any part of their body while talking on their phone while driving if you dont follow these laws they can fine you fifty to one hundred and fifty dollars i feel that this action was necessary and justified to better protect our society', 'being on your device and driving could be an overly dangerous choice in life many people around the world are injured by this situation every day it could lead to accidents and altercations in addition it would even cost you your licences the most detrimental outcome is death there are far more outcomes to operating a motor

condition in an motor vehicle accident there is more than one involved there is another person or group of people that could have the exact same conditions than the driver on the cell phone in an example of an altercations you could be more prone to damaging an building or such an direct result of an event in place a fee or very large payment would need to be made secondly another consequence could be having your license takenwhen you have violated a driving law there will always be an consequence rather it being jail time injuries or more your license will be subjected to suspension a suspended license defines as you are not able to drive until they are reinstated the process can take anywhere from a short period of time or even a long period of time the average time for a suspended license is sixty daysfor some people if it is not your first offense they may even take your license for good furthermore there is another cause to driving while being on your cell phoneafter all the consequences the most detrimental is death many people happen to pass away due to a motor vehicle car accident not all people pass away at the crash site some has a condition mild

driver and the unlucky few that may have been in the car around or in another car passing away from a motor vehicle accident can be prevented by simply waiting until you have reached a stopping point or your at your destination to pick up your phonein conclusion drivers should not be able to use cell phones in any capacity while operating a motor vehicle it can cause accidents and altercations

surroundings we may not intend to end someones life but we made the poor decision to drive and text so now we must live with that for the rest of our lifeeveryday people die in car accidents because we use cell phones while driving according to my research the number one leading car accidents are distracted drivers research shows that being on your phone while driving can cause the risk 4x more of a horrible crash because we use cell phones more often now we use our phones knowing the danger it could cause because we want to keep in touch with people they also think that the handfree is a safe thing to use because they are driving with two hands instead of holding the phonedriving with cell phones should be banned because of the many car accidents that they cause it causes someones insurance to rise and it causes concerns to peoples health i think people are more concerned with their conversation than with their own safety and the safety of others research has proven that people

distracted driving it is believed that the recorded number of distracted driving incidents is greatly underrecordedover 80 of drivers admit to not paying attention to the road while they are doing blatantly hazardous behaviors while driving the listed activities are not always the driver interacting with their phone however it is safe to assume that interacting with their phone is one of the many hazardous activities these drivers admitted to doing distracted driving is now considered to be the new drunk driving since it follows the same psychological pattern with recent studies of phone addiction showing some of the same signs as drug addiction people are having a harder time ignoring their phone it is no coincidence that car crashes are the number one killer of teens in the us and that 1619 year olds have a three times higher chance to be involved in a fatal crash than any other age group while studies show that teens and younger children are the most addicted to their phoneswhile it is dangerous to be interacting with your phone while driving some people have no choice in the matter reasons for this can range from work related texts or phone calls to family matters

phone while driving because of this law there have been multiple accessories made that allow drivers to mount their phones in their car so that they can send voice messages or speech to text messages

driving is in the top five causes for deaths and yet many states do not have laws against it we need to stand together united and encourage our congressmen to pass laws in order to combat this distractionand be mature and adultlike and discuss ways to not further endanger each othercellphones are brain washing us to think we always need it but i know we can break free from this horrible device with a little hard work we can make a change whats more important to you a notification or somebodys life our congressmen need to listen to our voices and make bills an laws and reforms to make

anytime including while driving which is a safety hazard a major cause of deaths in the us is motor vehicle accidents because of phone usage most of the time about 33700 people die in motor vehicle each year shown on cdc this means that some of the accidents are from phone usage and other factors but if people stop using their phones while driving their could be less accidents in the future in the article mobile phones and driving safety it stated thatin a 2011 study it was reported that over 90 of college students surveyed texts initiatereplyor read while driving it proves that even adults can be immature that they use their phones while driving even when knowing the possible consequences they may have if people continue to use phones while driving then the rate of death will get higher and people would think that nothing will happen to them while using their phonesmany people may say that teens are the ones driving irresponsibly by using their phones when operating a vehicle in reality everyone from every age is irresponsibly driving according to an article of  teen driver source in 2015 42 percent of high school students who drove in the past 30 days reported sending a text or email while drivingthe other half were most likely adults in which adults should set younger people an influence because they learn from them in another passage on science daily stated that adults are always on their phone while driving with young kids either by sending a text reading texts on social media or their just distracted driving i believe that the adults should be more cautious including the teens but adults tend to have younger kids with them in the carboth the adults and teens are guilty of driving on their phones but they should learn sooner to avoid any type of tragedyeach state in the us has their own laws to protect their people since some dont listen the people in charge of the state theyve made laws for people who drive careless about 43 states have prohibited drivers to text or even be on their phones facts  statistics about texting and driving even though not all states have been prohibited of being on their phones almost all of them have which is a good difference in some states if the police stops you for the first time for texting and driving you can get a fee depending where you live for example georgia has a fee of 150 florida has one of 30and new jersey has one of 400 the fee law is a good option because if they stop you a second time then you could have jail time if you didnt learn the first time from the fee if the us keeps making stricter laws of being on the phone while driving then the people will learn', 'driving and texting is something very common but a serious problem with detrimental effects the main detrimental effect could be physical when a person texts and drives a person could cause an accident which could not only endanger themselves but it could endanger othersaccording to the national safety council cell phone use while driving leads to 16 million crashes each year these are deaths added to this already hectic world that could have been easily avoidednot only can texting while driving affect a person physically but it can also affect a person mentallywhile physical damage to a vehicle or physical injury to a person can often be resolved in a matter of days or weeks emotional damage may last a lifetime author and blogger rebecca goldfarb recently categorized the types of emotional damage as shock anger guilt anxiety and depression and even posttraumatic stress goldfarb added many people who are involved in an accident as either the driver or as the victim often need to receive professional care if the difficult emotions are lasting longer than expectedthe final way in which driving while distracted may negatively affect a person is financially according to the website big az big media there are six types of costs that may happen following a car accident the first two immediate financial costs involve the repair of personal property and the costs with healthcare and medical treatment the second two financial costs involve possible legal fees and an increase to car insurance finally the last two costs involve the loss of employment income and benefits and the possible cost of a career change if the person cannot return to their job', '', 'throughout the years teenagers have been eager to turn 16 driving is a nerve wrecking and exciting experience at the same time there is a good upside about driving and that would be being able to go out to places without having to pay and the time period you can stay out for is how long you desire even though there is a good side there is a bad side as well this would have to be the large amount of people that are not cautious around their surroundings and many lives have been taken away due to this i would have to agree with the idea that says that phones should not be used while driving  my reasons for this are that peoples lives are taken away a phone is a big distraction and it is a law you have to followmy first reason on why phones should not be used while driving is because too many lives are taken everyday utilizing a phone while driving takes many lives every second of our daily lives about 16 million lives a year end up in critical conditions or worse dead a phone call or text can wait but being impatient can result in deaths this impatiences creates danger to the person driving and everyone around them too many lives are taken by near accidents crashes distractions and running of lights caused by usage of phones by operating moving vehicles many more lives could be safer if people chose to wait for their usage of phones after being off the roadmy second reason on why phones should not be used while driving is because too many distractions are already on the road without adding a phone as another reason once again using a phone while driving creates too many distractions for the driver and everyone around is left in danger for example phones can create delays on stop lights which can create simple accidents the glare of a bright phone on a dark night can actually interfere with the sight of the driver and can cause loss of control or misguidance to swerving as well as sudden loud sounds from a phone can actually scare or frighten a driver straight to a crash occuping phones while driving is one of the biggest reasons for caused crashes all overmy third and final reason for not using phones while driving is because a new law recently has been released on how using phones on the road is no longer permitted anymore the new law was put in to ensure more safety due to all the distractions caused by phones since it is a new law a new law means that it is expected to be followed a new set out rule it is for the safety of people and everyone surrounding people will get punished if the new law is not followed and in my opinion i would say that it is one of the greatest laws forced the new law will minimize the amount of crashes caused by phones on the road all over and save many more lives and everyone arounda phone should not ever be used while a person is driving for any type of situation it can wait my reasons once again like i said before is that many lives are taken away it is also a big distraction and last would be that it is a new law a phone is really entertaining and that is something people do not want behind the wheel because then it can become a distraction', 'in this day in age of technological advancement mankind has quickly adapted to using devices such as cellphones it has gotten to the point where we constantly use it for everything we do there seems to be many good qualities about the cellphone which humans seem to keep all are attention on that in turn causes problems with our surroundings such as being on the phone and driving a vehiclethere is no denying that cellphones take up all of our attention there are just so many things that we are able to do that makers have put in it it is just to ensure that we never get bored while also waiting for the next phone with technological superiority to be released likewise with driving it takes up all of our focus to make sure we dont get into a car wreck in a way driving and being on a cellphone are very similar in regards to how much attention we give it so when putting both together the ending result are what you would expect it to be catastrophiccellphones and driving take up a lot of focus and because of that we constantly are switching from looking at our phones to paying attention to the road and oncoming traffic ahead assuming there is any that is they do not balance out well and people can easily get into car accidents as a result this most notably happens when a person is trying to text and drive at the same time it was this very reason why texting and driving has been made illegal to ensure the safety of fellow drivers you would think the problems lay with teenagers doing it but adults have a higher statistic level when it comes to this providing more fatality rates to go up add that in with alcohol and there is no telling what will happenin the end we just should not use our phones while we drive it quickly turns into a habit once we start and it will not end well it can also result in being arrested if caught by a local police officer we should get everything out of the way before we start driving or stop and park somewhere before we engage into the activities on our phone there are plenty of safe ways to use a phone while inside of a vehicle we just choose the most dangerous route', 'to start things off i believe that there is a time and place for being on your phone with behind the wheel if you are at a red light and you dont have to type or just have to answer a call or change a song i believe that is an acceptation to the rule of being on your phone since we are in the time and age were we have bluetooth in cars and can connect to our phones so it makes it easier to call and or answer calls texting and driving is a must stop because you may think that you will be fine and can multitask but in reality you are putting you and the other drivers in danger no ones parents should have to attend their childs funeral because they died from texting and driving or because someone else was texting and driving there are many reasons not to use a phone while driving but there are also exceptions to this rule now you may not agree with me on this but this to me is the best actions to do because people will not stop with getting on their phones while driving but at least we could limit it to just a few ways that they could get on it while being behind the wheelsecondly with technology still evolving in this day like now they are getting driverless cars that may be the next big step in the world of vehicles now with these cars we dont need to worry about the needs of driving cars if there is no steering wheelevery day about 11 teens die due to texting and driving in the united states but with todays technology they are trying to help stop texting and driving but everything we do doesnt seem to be helping and or stopping teens from texting behind the wheel some people still might not agree with me on what i believe is important but if you just give it some years maybe just maybe it may be possible in todays society that no one can get hurt from texting and drivinglastly although its a big problem for people to stop texting and driving its not a ban in every state in the united states its said that only 39 states put a ban for novice drivers because it isnt the biggest deal for some people to be able to text and drive which i know doesnt sound great but its kind of the truth in a way i personally have no experience of this because i cant drive but i see people who do drive and do this and its not like its every time it mainly at red lights you see them doing it now out the 39 states 20 of them ban it for school bus drivers alsoits taken the usa almost 14 years and people still dont listen to no texting and driving', 'according to the national safety council reports cell phone use while driving leads to 16 million crashes each year 390000 injuries occurred caused by cell phone use and driving nearly 6000 pedestrians are killed because of this as well phones should not be used while driving not only because the dangers that occur but also because the people that are harmed or killed and it couldve been preventedits rare that the driver ever gets hurt its always the person they hit or theyve caused a lot of damage cell phones are a huge distraction while driving a vehicle your not paying attention to the road in front of you because something has caught your eye below the dashboard something that couldve waited until you arrived at your destination sometimes you have to ask yourself is it really that important2018 an estimate of 15 million car accidents in the us cell phone use while driving resulted in 3000 to 6000 people getting killed or injured each year all because someone couldnt leave their phone leave for awhile now they have to deal with peoples lawyers and insurance company just everything that couldve been avoided creating unnecessary problems for yourselfmay 29 2019 a new law was created it prohibits people driving to not use their cell phones if a person was to disregard this law the result would be paying a 50 fine for first offense thats one way to avoid the dangers and consequences of texting and driving another one is to make a mental

almost everyone thats driven a car has done it and they know it a lot of people do it but that obviously doesnt make it right of course lots of things have come out so that we wont have the phone in our hands while driving but who said that having a phone in your hand is the only problem phones cause for distractions accidents and possibly even jail timethe last thing that you want while driving is to get distracted i think i could say the same thing for a passenger have you ever been in a car with someone and they start looking at their phonehave they ever got on the phone and laughed so hard that they close their eyes while driving its not a good feeling to be in a situation such as that cause you worry about your life handsfree calls are good but just because they dont have a phone in their hand does not mean a person still cannot get distracted due to the use of a phonedistraction due to phones could result in multiple things one of the things it can result in is pedestrians getting hurt in the state of georgia pedestrians are given the rightofway when crossing a marked crosswalk pedestrians are required to yield the rightofway to oncoming vehicles when crossing the street without a marked crosswalk if drivers arent paying attention then they might just hit a pedestrian and it might just be on the driver drivers could be so distracted due to cell phones that they run a stop light and end up hitting a pedestrianone of the main reasons for car wrecks in the united states is not driving under the influence or speeding the main cause for car wrecks in america is distracted driving people dont realize how easily a person could get in a car wreck looking at a text or notification on your phone could take your eyes off the road for almost 5 seconds 5 seconds doesnt sound like a lot of time but it really doesnt even take a full second for a car wreck to actually happenwhen using your phone while driving you should ask yourself a few questions do i', 'in todays day and age technology has drastically increased people now days seem to rely on their devices more than anything people surely cant get their eyes off the devices for more than at least a minute they look at the phone while walking eating at a dinner table or even in class while their supposed to be learning but the main problem that is occurring is people texting on their phone while driving an automobile this brings up the question if drivers should or shouldnt be able to use their cellphones in any capacity while operating a vehiclein my perspective i believe drivers shouldnt be able to use their cellphones while driving for starters youre taking your eyes off the road this is extremely dangerous because it only takes five seconds minimal amount of your time taken away from the road for an extreme accident to occur for example if u is driving at 55mph while texting or looking at your phone within them seconds you could have easily got into a car accident with major injuries this reason is only one reason you shouldnt be able to use your cellphone while drivinganother reason that you shouldnt be able to use your cellphone while driving is it puts your life at risk and put other innocent lives at risk when you make the decision to text and drive you make the decision to risk the lives of those around you and your life as well that simple action of answering a quick text or even glancing at a text means that you are selfishly putting other peoples lives in danger it is one thing to put your own life in danger but it is unfair and unnecessary to risk the lives of others these innocent people young children friends in your car pedestrians and fellow drivers did absolutely nothing wrong and are forced to have their lives at risk solely due to a poor decision that you madethe last and final reason is that its illegal regardless of the all the harm caused by texting and driving it is also illegal in many states fines and punishments for texting and driving range greatly depending on the state that you live in for some states the fine is merely 20 however in others it can be up to 500 and if the action of texting and driving ends in injuring any other individuals you can actually end up in jail depending on the severity of the injury this right here is just the icing on the cake as to why you should stop texting and driving', 'even though phones have caused a lot of accidents and deaths i believe that certain uses of the phones should be allowed while driving sometimes people get emergency phone calls and emergency text that they need

distraction while driving some people just need it at the timeeven though i believe that using your phone while driving is a good idea there are many cons to this idea a lot of car accidents had to do with the involvement of teens and adults using their cellular device phones have cause a lot of deaths not just in america but across the world i believe there should be more laws made that does not

dont know better teen drivers or new drivers in general should take a proper drivers ed class thatll teach them proper drivers etiquette this will inform them of the dangers of texting and driving and teach them techniques to avoid temptationalthough the use of cell phones should be restricted it shouldnt be completely prohibited drivers often use their phones for gps in this day and age if phones are permanently prohibited then drivers wont be able to use their mobile map it navigates the driver to where they need to go apps have been programmed so that drivers can use their gps handsfree they also input a feature that will speak the directions out loud so the driver doesnt feel the constant need to pick their phone up and read the directions all the driver has to do is input their destination in before the vehicle starts moving phones while driving doesnt need to be prohibitedsome people will argue that the usage of any phones can start any car accident while that is true it is highly unlikely and implausible although texting and driving is the cause of many car accidents its not the cause for all of them phones cannot be blamed for every car accident that happens in fact drunk driving is the cause for 31 of car accidents that occur in the country taking away the cell phone completely from use in the vehicle will have a poor effect on the drivers who need gps to go to new places and dont end up lost it will lead to drivers needing maps which are often hard to read and hard to keep track of', 'according to edgar snyder  associates nearly 390000 injuries occur each

that texting by voice and by looking at your phone the reaction time is still the samethe hands free law can affect you in a positive or negative way yes talking on the phone while your driving is a dangerous distraction many studies have shown that the level of distraction has more to do with the intensity of the conversation stated in the total bans may be impractical debate studies show an in depth conversation that requires a good deal of thought causes a higher level of distraction than a relatively short the time and the length of the phone call is what is dangerous', 'you should not speak with your mobile phone while driving you will be distracted by telephone conversation this is similar to driving while you are drunk if you talk on the phone while driving the reaction may be delayed if accidental driving hazards occur or you will never feel danger until too late more and more research shows the danger of distracting and hands free phones do not seem to bring much improvement if any there are more incidents of speaking on the phone than text messages but this may be due to the fact that the the phone is widely used compared to text messages', 'although cell

sometimes there are emergency phone calls that make you feel like they cant wait especially with the growth of technology drivers are most likely to grab their cellphones many of these reasons are the main cause of car accidents that happen in todays world with distractions from the road drivers are most likely to swerve into the other lane or crash into another therefore drivers should not be able to use cell phones in any capacity while operating a vehicle for the safety of others and for themselvesdue to a report of accidents that happened in 2018 about 40000 people lost their lives to car crashes and 4637 of those people died in the crash due to cell phone usage texting and driving can cause about 5 times as many accidents as drunk driving technology has grown and so has the usage of cellphones nowadays people use their phone to locate the nearest coffee shop or to watch their shows the thing is they watch it at the most inappropriate time instead of focusing on the road the driver puts all their attention towards the phone causing them to swerve into the other lane or hit another car thats slowing down on the highway in the state of georgia there was a bill that was passed known as the house bill 673 this bill is also known as the hands free law   this law basically says that under no condition should the cellphone be in the drivers hand at any time the consequence of this bill is a fine of 50150 depending on the offence google with this bill passed many more civilians will be able to not use their phone and be less likely to get into accidents because if the driver gets caught with it they will have to pay a fine and get a point on their licensetexting and driving is not only risky but can put the driver and other drivers on the road lives

horror themselves or had lost a loved one due to an event like the mother of a teen in washington who died after she was allegedly distracted by an incoming text while driving teensafe com the mother now helps teens understand the dangers and uses a video that recreates her daughters crash to illustrate the horror', 'in todays society people have and use cell phones cell phones have become an addiction people cant seem to put them down some people feel that people should not use their phones while driving their cars i feel this way too using cell phones while driving have negative consequences in two ways one cell phones distract the driver two cell phones are unsafeto begin with phones can easily distract the person whos driving the car the reason is that when that person is driving his car and when a notification ringer goes off the driver would rush to his phone to see what came up when this happens he would then lose focus on the road and might kill someone whenever someone is driving his car he needs to focus on the road at all times distract driving is one of the main reasons why theres more car accidents in this country especially georgia when the government starts enforcing no phones while driving this will help end distractive driving and less car accidents would happen in cities and on the highway cell phones distracting the drivers is one of the main points why people should not use their phones while driving a carnext drivers who use their phones while driving can be unsafe for the driver and other people who are around them the reason is that when drivers are driving they need to check their surroundings to make sure they do not hit someone or something in the case of using a phone while driving can cause many deaths from getting run over hit from the car or from a car crash this is really important that people need to be aware of what theyre doing because if they make one mistake it can cause a lot of lives safety is really important when it comes to using a phone because people can save lives if they put the phone down and focus on the road so that everyone can create a safer environment for people who want to drive their car most deaths are caused by car accidents due to using the phone while driving because people do not think about being safe not only for themselves but also the passengers who are in the car with them safety is one thing people need to take a stand on because drivers need to realize that if they do not put the phone down then it could create more deaths and less safety in the area', 'many habitants of planet earth have and use their cellular device as second nature cellphones while useful in the sense of communication entertainment and business transactions can be dangerous tools of distraction behind the wheel an example of this would be the statistics based on vehicular manslaughter and other effects of the car accidents that are recorded each year tens of thousands of americans are victims of car accidents every year with the distraction of cellphones being the lead cause for fender benders every year governments officials and representatives are faced with the same issue and must constantly find a solution to the issue of cellphone use behind the wheel the main question being whether cell phone use should be allowed at all while operation heavy machinerythat being said it would be for the better of humanity if cellphones be allowed only when at a complete stop with the vehicle in park the reason why the allowance would be more beneficial than the stripping of the whole ability is because of the instinctual nature of humans to do what seems good even if it is forbidden this can be seen in the book of genesis where eve chooses the forbidden fruit over every other fruit in the garden due to the thought that she would never be able to taste that specific fruit if she were to obey gods orders this shows the weakness in man that even if he or she should be shunned smitten banished or punished in any way by the highest power man shall carry out the forbidden just to have a form of secret libertythis liberty would remain in the citizens mindsets if they had the ability of freedom that would be disguised by regulations the perception of a freedom is a more effective way to regulate the general population that the prohibition of the acts that are the root of a problem such as the case of the dangers of texting and driving the first regulation would include the full stop of a vehicle ensuring that the driver is not endangering the lives of everybody else when they need their phone the second part of the new rule would call for the mandatory parking of the car so that the car has no potential to endanger the other lives on the road these rules would send the message that the nation needs to stay focused on the task of driving and should refrain from getting distracted by phone usethe task of driving is a boring task thus the temptation of using a device to make the job of travel less monotonous becomes more alluring to the driver therefore the use of cell phones should still be partially allowed for those who ride the road every day to ask for the privilege be taken all together would cause uproar and rebellion but to give that chance to change a song on the phone or to reroute the gps software on the phones leaves a margin of freedom for the civilians who are forced to follow the policy without those exact laws every nation will continue to face accidents and become yet another percentage on the yearly submission of the quota for accidents and deaths caused using cell phones', 'should people have the privilege andor the right to be able to have their phone out inside the car while there are some good reasons why you should have the right there are some things that people just cant helpwe already cant stop all the people that use their phones while they drive and now a days more and more people are getting addicted to their phones almost making it impossible to put down even while just having a simple dinner let alone putting it down while there driving most people dont even realize that there even doing it and most care now a days have the bluetooth or people sell bluetooth devices so you can be on call and drive while you drive making it better for the people but as tested on mythbusters changes a little but still distracts you in some sort of way people also know there way around things already and sometimes work or no most of the times it works but some of the times it doesnt under a code of law because there are not enough laws in places or fine print and they can just say oh well its like a bluetooth but it wasnt type of stuff and the court cant do anything about itthis is what i think about the phones calls and driving is may not be clear cause there really is no answer to this question for me personally i dont care what they do or say all i care about is if our people our safe there really is no reason for people to be not allowed to have there phones in a car or make calls or answer them maybe there should a cam in every car that shows whenever your texting and driving or have your phone up against your ear just so if the other person that gets hit they have the cam to see if there were texting or on a call whenever you are driving and get into accident hopefully no but still you would have the prove that they were on it meaning the phone or notthey cops think they can just lie as well but with that cam they cant lie or anything even know they shouldnt even if its an exsaturration it still means something in the court of law it could either mean good or bad for the person testifying what they did or didnt do and with that cam there is no more lying anymore and takes away more problems like for example whowhat happened before the crash how many people were really in the car and finally how they got hit and out of the car if camera is in correct placement in every car sadly they all have to be in different placement in each variety of car', 'your main concern while your driving is that you obey the law and dont get in any wrecks your cellphone should

if your job requires this its ok people always tend to be distracted by their devices which leads to them blindly making mistakes that could have easily been avoided if their head wasnt stuck in a phone with that being said the question for today is should phones be allowed while driving in an automobilei personally dont think that phones should be allowed while driving unless you have your phone propped up in your car and youre using it for directions therefore youre in a place of need for your device otherwise i dont think you should be recklessly texting and driving because that doesnt only put you and your passengers in danger of crashing but also everyone else on the road around you these types of fatal accidents always happen because people think they can be aware enough to be on their phone and drive an estimated amount of about 391000 people were injured in texting and driving related crashes in 2017 this goes to show that you should always be careful because i am pretty sure everyone of those 300 thousand people didnt plan on getting into an accident before it happenedtexting and driving is dangerous it kills hundreds of people every year especially since there are new drivers every year teen drivers are usually the ones who text and drive the most which is another reason why teen crashes are at an alltime high that doesnt mean adults dont do it i personally know someone who was always on their phone when they were drivingtexting talking or just catching up on social media which is so irrelevant while you are driving this person didnt learn until they crashed their car by rear ending a truck and can you guess why this incident happened it was because she was talking on her phone while it happenedbeing on your phone and driving can be avoided with all the technology we are starting to have now now we have tools that can hold your phone in a visible position without distracting your view from the road and you dont have to hold it modern vehicles are also being made with built in screens which is like its own phone in the car which you can operate while parked and some features while you are driving society is constantly upgrading so that incidents like these can stop happening so much because they are so preventful we as a society are starting to put our phones down especially because if you are seen by a police officer with a phone in your hand while youre driving you can instantly get pulled over and get a ticket', 'drivers should not be able to use cell phones while driving you shouldnt be on your phone while driving it causes all types of tragic deaths the best way to stop it is to enforce the no use law people die almost every day from this when you drive and text it causes accidents and deaths

rates has increaseusing your phone and driving is just like drinking and driving i saw my mother actually texting and driving and she slam on brakes it was very scary at the moment because we were young people just love to do that im not going to lie if the phone call is important to me i am going to answer it but i will try to pull off of the road first i do not want to cause an accident and

phone company att in 2010 to raise awareness by spreading this message this message was put on billboards tv commercials and cereal boxes a phone company wanted drivers to know that looking at your

societymany states have acted on the matter and have a hands free ban while driving nobody ever needs to use their phone while driving you are supposed to be concentrated at all times while behind the wheel one of the main reasons people are still disregarding this rule is because theyre using their phone most times throughout the day and cant be without even while driving the national safety

only danger you take you also put other peoples life in danger in some cases you could hit someone hurt them really badly or even kill them remembering what you did to the other person would not be your only punishment you could go to jail and spend a long time in their just for the distraction of a couple seconds some of the reasons why people think its a good thing is because they feel the

are also many more reasons why people are on their phoneevery person has a different excuse or reason why they are texting and driving but in overall there are some that are the most common of them all you would imagine that being on a phone call would be top 3 or 5 but its not that commun seeing people on a phone call one of the main reasons its obviously texting another big reason is facebook snapchat any social media a big reason is the camera women just be taking pictures or videos of themselves while on the other side guys have the trend to speed or drive recklessly and record it to show it off you also have people who find it entertaining to shop online or be reading the news as well as checking the weather when people are really bored while driving or get stuck in traffic for a long period of time they are also watching videos or even movies', 'the call or text can wait because you have to take your eyes off the road to answer or reply many times when youre texting and

'as a result cell phones have caused automobile accidents which have unfortunately led to deathsin my opinion drives should not be able to use cell phones if they are held in ones hand however they should be allowed to use cell phones in hands free mode as follows while operating a vehicle1 to talk andor talk text via bluetooth 2 to use maps andor a navigation system and 3 for entertainment purposes such as listening to music and the ability to watch movies especially during cross county traveltalking and texting while driving has become a hot topic in recent years mainly because of more and more humans using cell phones on a daily basis and the rise in traffic accidents due to talking andor texting i will agree that drivers can get distracted while talking on the cell phone while using their handsi will also agree that drivers can get distracted by using their hands to text because the driver is constantly looking up and down which results in loss of concentration and attention to other drivers and to the road however a solution to the problem would be to mandate that all drives must use hands free mode via bluetooth or you will be in violation of the law and can get a traffic ticket if seen using your handsbefore the cell phone humans used actual paper maps to navigate the worlduntil the early 2000s when cell phones came with satellite navigation via goggle maps software and apps such as mapquest and waze which allow the driver to get directions to their destinations via the cell phonenavigation systems usually speak to the driver via the sound system in the vehicle which allow the driver to not use their handshowever there are times that drivers use their hands to see the maps therefore resulting in a traffic accidents a solution to this issue would be to require all drivers to use the hands free mode while using navigation systemsthe internet has allowed for cell phones to have the ability to play radio stations from all over the country and not just local radio stationsthe internet has also allowed for humans to download their favorite music to their cell phones which they can then listen to the music via the phonethe internet has also given humans the ability to watch television and movies via the cell phone by using apps such as youtube and netflixmusic has probably least likely to cause drivers to get distractedhowever movies have most likely caused traffic accidents because the driver looks up and down at the screen losing concentration while drivinga solution to this problem would be that the driver can only listen to music while driving and only the passengers can watch movies while the driver is driving which are all hands free solutionsin conclusion it is my opinion that drivers should be able to use cell phones in the capacity of hands free mode while operation a vehiclethe actual cell phone device is really not the issue that causes traffic accidents it is basically the user lacking concentration not paying attention and not using hands free mode that causes traffic accidents', 'cell phones have been around for years but just in the past few they have become hazardous due to people using them in cars

occur because of a text now think about in old times when texting while driving was not a problem at allauthorities put down strict detailed laws about having your phone in your hand while driving each offence doubles every time you get caught but this law was hardly effective because no one is taking the safer advice to insure the safety of yourself and others on the roads the fines would turn into something more serious and if you got into a wreck injuring another person you could more than likely spent some jail timei know phones shouldnt be allowed to be messed with while you are driving because imagine if it were you in the situation and getting into a wreck all because someone was paying attention to their phone and not the road you could lose it all in a blink of an eye or you could make someone else lose everything dont be that person because either one there are causes and effects to your actions even if you didnt get hurt  you probably hurt someone else that has family that loves them like crazy', 'the issue of driving while the person is on the cell phone and is a major issue in georgia and all the other states of america many accidents are happening daily and people are losing their lives this way many fatal accidents happened and even small kids lose their lives the law has been made in georgia that requires hands free driving that means people can drive and talk on the phone without touching the phone the law is still not as helpful as expected because many people ignore law many peoples mind is still distracted and many people still use their hands for navigation the first reason is many people are still ignoring the law because the charges are very low if they get caught the insurance rates are nit going to hike much for them auto correct mishaps are hiking and people are texting even if it is not legal it is more dangerous than drinking and driving the law must be strict and have a penalty that must be 1000 dollars or get arrested just in case of emergency driver should pull over and talk on the side if the road the second reason is many people have stressful jobs and they attend a conference call or any stressful situations in the family front while driving this can distract their mind from driving and even the handsfree driving law cant be helpful to prevent car wrecks in this situation the law should be made very strictly that person can talk hands free for only few minutes and eliminates other conversations while driving only important conversations should be allowed this law can save so many pedestrians too who runs into a car wreck daily one example is of an old lady in atlanta she was run over by a driver in the evening and he didnt even stop after words two weeks ago according to the news the lady ended up dying on the street right on the spot the third reason i have is people do not talk over the phone always but people can use their phone for navigation music and apps so those things are also distracting the law should be made by the government that they can tract the minimum usage while driving and even if they must set up the navigation they can pull over and do it so they can pull over to the side to use the phone and should be made on the interstate and the street in conclusion the usage of the cell phone in the car cant be eliminated totally because cellphones are for emergency use by only communicating important things and concentrate on driving it can turn into a car wreck and pedestrians can get into an accident', 'cell phones have caused so many deaths or even fatal car accidents over the past in an article by teensafe com it states that in 2015 391000 injuries were caused in distracted driving related accidents this means that in 2015 there were a total of 9 people killed by distracted driving a day imagine you driving down the road not even knowing what the person next to you behind you may be doing maybe their texting on their phone answering a call or even trying to set up their gps and then all of a sudden boom your into a major car accident that could be the death of you cellphones are very dangerous and will continue to be throughout the years and comingso many teens dream of having their own cars some are lucky enough to actually be gifted it to them by their parents the only scary part about it is that some teens dont understand the responsibility behind driving a vehicle without their parents or having someone to make sure they are driving safely in an article posted by teenssafe com it states each day11 teens die in crashes caused by texting and driving that means 11 teens are dead each die due to a simple text sent or received while driving imagine if you had a teen child who drove their own vehicle they could fall into being those 11 people who die a day honestly anyone could fall into that category its not just only teensusing your phone while driving is life risking and very dangerous especially when the person behind the wheel is irresponsible just imagine losing a loved one due to someone who couldnt wait to send a text message till they go to their destination in my opinion a cellphone or any form of technology should be out of anyone who is operating a vehicle hand maybe you wait to get home or wherever you must go to send a message its always better safe than sorry not only are the people operating the vehicle the ones in danger but sometimes even the passengers or the person in the other cars can be harmed or sometimes even end up dead', 'there is no doubt that with how advanced technology has become in the past few years or so people have really advanced the technological possibilities people have now started to make some of the ais artificial intelligence like alexa and google home there are even some cars that allow you to ask it questions in order to find out the weather or finding the fastest route to take to work along with all of these technological advancements comes the ability to hook the phone up to a car using bluetooth now should drivers be able to use their phones in the car while drivingthere are some really good uses for using the bluetooth phone hookup for one in georgia people are not allowed to drive if they have their phone in their hand this is where the bluetooth phone hookup comes in handy because you can do in the car phone calls to work or to somewhere else this feature can come in really handy because if someone takes a day off of work and someone from their work calls them and starts to ask questions they can answer those questions right then and there that way if someone was ever needed to give someone some advice in their place of work they could just click a button and give them the advice over the phonethere is also another use for the phone hookup to the car feature and that is so that someone can get notified if they do happen to have a family emergency this is so that if someone does happen to have a family emergency and they are in the car already all they have to do is drive over to where the family emergency actually is this is so that you can get notified if something bad does happen to someones family member they wont have to wait until they get home to find out what happenedonce again being that when they do find out instead of having to leave the house again to go and see what happened because this person is actually out and about all they have to do is go to the place of the emergency this may be one of the sadder ways that a phone can be used for while driving but it still is one of the more important thingsthe next reason for why people should be able to use their phone while driving is what if someone has to call the police using the bluetooth phone hookup feature that most cars have nowadays someone can call up the police and say that they need assistance with something for instance lets say that someone has a very strong feeling that they are being stalked on the way home from work or somewhere else so they can then call the police for their assistance this can also be a real life saver because this can also be used if someones water breaks on the way to the hospital that way someone can go ahead and let the hospital know what is happening so someone wont have to wait so in short phones can be used to save someones life', 'according to the

tune everything else out we constantly stay on our cellphones to distract us from the problems that are happening in the real world we use our phones everywhere we go but we never watch our surroundings when driving it is important to know your surrounding but when youre distracted by messages and phone calls and social media it puts the passengers and your life at riskeveryday people die in car accidents because they use cell phones while driving according to research cell phones are leading factors that cause accidents studies show that a cell phone put drivers at four times greater risk of a crash despite a danger people still use cell phones because they want to be always available and keep in touch with other people also they think that handsfree set is safe because they can drive using two hands moreover they use arguments that cell phones are necessary for emergency situations although some people support using cell phones while driving there is evidence that they are dangerous and people should avoid talking while driving', 'people driving while looking at their phones has become an epidemic and is a big cause of a lot of accident primarily involving teens who are so distracted by their phones that they are not paying any attention to the road with the growing number of car accidents happening they have put into place the handsfree law so that it

the car we have cellphones that control tvs and we have a computer that does things humans have hard time doing when technologies combine they make our lives easier likewise using a cellphone while driving is okaypeople may argue that using a cellphone while driving is dangerous but any technology if used wrong can be deadly to not only ourselves but lives around us therefore people should be able to use cellphone while driving but in a manner that is reasonable using gps global positioning system to guide your way or to listen to music is a good example of using cellphones safelyusing a gps system on your phone while driving helps us to get to our destination easier and lets us focus on the road better if we did not have a gps and we were to look for signs to go anywhere we would be very much likely to get distracted or get tired quickly yes it is true that we can replace our phones gps with a gps device but again if the driver is not misusing cellphones it is essentially getting the same job done also because smartphones are easier to control and easier to interact quick than a gps device it will reduce the frustration of the driverlistening to music can help the driver focus better it can also wake up a tired driver up by blasting some music however a gps device cannot do that with its monotone robotic voice it would make the driver get even more bored another reason why a smartphone cannot be replaced by gps device or why we should be able to use our cellphone is that in the case of an emergency drivers can easily access a smartphone and call for help while if you had a gps device not so much', 'to some being on the phone while driving is not a big deal at all while to others it is yet while for those certain people who think cellphone use while driving is not a big deal the statistics would suggest otherwise so far in the year 2018 it has been reported that over 58 of car accidents have been caused by or are linked to cellphone usethis alone would suggest that even for those who do not look at cellphone use while driving as a big deal that it obviously is one as a result of this the hands free law which has been around in some states for decades was recently added and enforced in many other states including georgia in july of 2018 the hands free law suggests that an driver who is caught driving with their phone in their hand will receive a ticket with a fine however you are allowed to use exactly one finger to navigate whatever it is you need on your device while this is an exception is it really much of a difference its still time b being devoting to something other than drivingwhile it is unfortunate for those who are capable of multitasking and are able to drive safely while using their phone overall it is much more beneficial to everyones safety if phones are just removed from the equation all together although unfortunately there are still millions of people who constantly break the laws each day and will continue to jeopardize everyones safety for their own personal satisfaction by using their devices while driving however i believe there are many more steps we could take to help decrease the cellphone use while driving some apps and even cellphones are working to prevent the usage while driving by adding improvements that can monitor when people have began to drive and will lock the phone automatically while some just will block usage unless you are a passenger this program is very helpful and a great encouragement but that still doesnt change the fact that the apps that people tend to use while driving arent doing anything of that sortin many situations people only understand the severity of things once they happen there are two different people int he world the better safe than sorry and the oh nothing will never happen i know what im doing people there are definitely not enough of the better safe then sorry people  as humans we think our problems are more important than others and that is definitely not what driving is about  driving is about watching your surroundings at all times and anything that distracts you from it is something you shouldnt be doingin conclusion cellphones and driving are just a bad combination that definitely has proven not to mix well yet sadly for some it is too large of a task to put the phone down and focus on the road while police and some software developers are doing everything they can to limit the use of cellphones in the car we will continue to see the problem for a while however it has been reported that in georgia since implementing the hands free law there has been a pretty significant decrease in accidents caused by cellphone usage noting that from january to june the percentage of accidents caused by cellphones was 67 but from july when the law was added up to now november accidents caused by cellphone use has dropped to just 39 in the state of georgia', 'in 2018 4637 people died in car crashes due to cell phone use in my

those seconds 94 percent of drivers support a ban on texting while driving 74 percent of drivers support a ban on handheld cell phone use the fact that those numbers do not equal out are problem and this is why i do not agree that people should be allowed to use their phone while drivingtexting while driving is a problem now more than it has ever been as 69 percent of us drivers between the ages of 18 and 64 admitted to using their cell phone while driving during the previous month texting increases a crash by 23 times its a habit that must be stopped across age groups and geographic locations alike 40 percent of teens state that theyve been in the car with a car with someone who was diving when using their cell phone in a way that put them in some kind of danger while the maximum amount of time a driver can safely can change their attention from the road from is two seconds it takes a driver five seconds on average to send a text message besides talking to your teen regularly about this issue and setting a good example by not using your cell phone while driving yourself there are other simple ways to monitor your teens phone use while theyre behind the wheel start by activating smartphone features that help prohibit texting while driving we need to take advantage of technology utilizing apps that allow you as the parent more transparency into your childs whereabouts and driving habitsin my opinion i think people should turn their phones off while driving in this generations words dont mean anything signs dont mean anything there are signs everywhere that say dont text and drive but due to the research nobody is listening companies are trying to go around this rule by making a profit what i mean by that is we say dont text and drive but heres an example apple air pods you simply tap your ear and say text so and so and in an instant your message has been sent to whoever i dont think thats safe either in no way is texting and driving safe even if you try to make it easier in my opinion there is no way that it can be safe if you take your eyes off the road for even a second the most dreadful things could happen to many people die for that one text back that could have waited until you stopped or could have waited until you got to a red light many teenagers dont know that you could ruin your in literally 5 secondsthere is one case in which your life can be saved when texting and driving there is a law called the hands free law texting and driving could either be paid with your life or a ticket in georgia the texting and driving ticket is the highest in the nation if you get caught in georgia that is a 150 ticket for violating the distracted driving law as well as one point on your driving record the highest ticket you could be fined to is 1000 in iowa i think youre better off just following the hands free law more money you get to keep in your pocket then to think about if youre texting and driving theres a possibility of you losing your life and a possibility of you killing someone else', 'should you be able to use your phone while driving i say you shouldnt because it can cause some of the scariest moments that

distractions while you are driving which can cause you to wreck and be seriously injured from it one of the biggest distractions in todays age is the use of cellphones with the improvements made to technology you can use cellphones anywhere on the road which causes it to be the number one distraction i personally feel that the use of technology should not be allowed while driving unless it is under an extreme circumstanceto begin one of the main reasons that causes cellphones to be one of the most distracting items is due to the texting and driving according to the national safety council they reported that cell phone use while driving leads to 16 million crashes each year they also reported that nearly 390000 injuries occur each year from accidents caused by texting while driving with those outrageously high statistics i strongly agree with the idea of doing away with cellphones while driving also 94 percent of drivers support a ban on texting while driving and 74 percent support a ban on hand held cell phone use having that high of a support percentage shows that are many other people who feel the same as i do it is a very dangerous problem that is going on in todays day with myself being a high school student and driver i can first hand tell you this is a major proem with teens i see many of my friends and also other students of my school using their cellphones while

ended off talking about the teens and cell phone use while driving situation as the majority of people know the using your phone is very dangerous and also distracting however with the teens situations there are 16year olds and older who are not that experienced with driving but are also more easily distracted then adults there was a poll made by aaa saying that 94 percent of teen drivers know the dangers of using their phone while driving and up to 34 percent admitted to doing it anyway with this kind of statistic just proves the point of not allowing any use of a phone in a motor vehicle i would also like to talk about the other drivers on the road there are many other safe and focused drivers on the road who are following all the rules of the road those careful drivers have also been the victims and ended up being seriously injured from the distracted driving with phones and also many other reasons i personally have an example to give with this problem my cousin was killed by a driver who was going down a road speeding in the rain and also texting while driving on top of all that phones being used in motorized vehicles is a serious issue and luckily a law has passed in the state of georgia stopping the use of them in cars but hopefully people will start to follow that lawthere are plenty of other distractions that go on when driving a motorized vehicle but the use of phones is most caused these deaths and accidents from distracted driving with your phones can be very managed if people were to follow the law of not using them in the car and to be more careful then these outrages percentages will become more and more less also i would like to express the fact that there are many options in vehicles that allow you to use your devices via bluetooth and voice control so if there was an emergency you can answer and talk on the phone without even having to pick up your phone and looking away this concludes my essay i strongly believe in not using

my own words i think of this as both hands on the wheel this is the way that drivers should drive all the time with both hands on the wheel using one hand to call someone could cause you to not be able to react in an emergency if an animal jumped in front of a car of someone using a hand to see the map on their phone for directions it could lead them to crashing and harming the animal because

something should not be the dangers of it everything including phones and driving are dangerous in themselves but the more they are done the worst they get with this being known would someone try to

placed as a consequence for cell phone usage the fines are to get fewer people to use their phones but it really is not much of a help many think they should be able to use their phones so the fines do not really mean much to them for example people say if you do not pay this phone bill then you shouldnt be able to tell me what to do with it in the other case many people do it without thinking

be help full is that it would be easier to call for roadside assistances if i were to have a break down i could call to have my car towed away and have a ride home i also could use it to call for someone else who need roadside assistance and may not have access to it it can also be used for traffic reports if theres heavy traffic or theres been a wreck and you can call for helpthe reason driving with a phone would be bad is that you could easily be distracted by it and can get in a wreck or cause one being on the phone with someone may cause you not to hear someone honking at you

statistics the us department of transportation reported that cell phone use while driving kills up to 30006000 people every year miller and zois 2019  this is because when checking your notifications which seems to only require a quick glance down at your phone that is all the time it takes to cause an accident i have personally experienced being in a vehicle with a distracted driver that was attempting to reply to a text message and slowly lost control of the cars position in a lane what if a car in the opposite lane was doing the same thing at the same time we could have collided easily have you ever been driving just to be stopped at a light longer than the light is red that would be compliments of another distracted driver in front of you and looking down at their phone instead of up at the light then theres the distracted driver that missed the bike rider parallel to them simply because of taking their eyes off of the road brieflythe thought of having your emails social media

playlist and music apps rather than listening to the radiolastlywe have the unpredictable emergencies that happen on the roads if we are distracted by our cell phones that causes a delay in our reaction to emergencies ive often been driving myself and witnessed another driver having a tire blow out if i was distracted by my phone that would have prevented my quick thinking and ability to avoid the collision i have also driven behind cars with missing brake lights the only way i knew they were about to stop was because of my ability to visually scan my surroundings and to be aware of when the light changes or if i need to quickly switch lanes to avoid hitting them from behind what about the recent incident of a tree collapsing on the highway if everyone was distracted everyones ability to react would be compromised causing an even larger highway collisionin conclusion i am anticell phone usage while driving the bottom line is when you are driving the operation of that

wait until youre at your destination think of it this way to use my phone while driving could mean life or death if you ever thought about a friend you forgot to call back or a text to reply to it can

texts or social media feed updates you would be more convinced to check your phone the safest thing to do would be to keep your phone on do not disturb or silent if you dont think about your phone the safer you will be as the temptation to use or check your phone would be diminishednow you might be thinking what if theres an emergency and i need to be contacted immediately the safest thing to do

slam on your breaks at the last second so the person behind you hits you what if you cant stop in time so you have to swerve over in any of these situations you have put someone else and yourself in

usually does with atlanta traffic starting to kick in a little further down the interstate on the other side there was a ton of traffic we looked as we went by all the fire trucks and police cars and there was an 18wheeler and a smaller car the smaller car was up under the front of the 18wheeler later that night my parents had the news on and it said that the driver of the 18wheeler was on their
